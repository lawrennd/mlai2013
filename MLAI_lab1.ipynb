Let's explore what happens as we increase the number of samples. To do this we are going to use for loops and python lists. We start by creating empty lists for the means and variances. Then we create a list of integers to iterate through. In Python, a for loop always iterates through a list (in some languages this is called a foreach loop, its counterpart the counter for loop only exists by creating a list of integers, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreach_loop#Python). We can use the range command to create the numbers of samples. "
