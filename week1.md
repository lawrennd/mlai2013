Uncertainty and Probability
===========================

### More Machine Learning Motivation

Neil's Inaugural lecture is available
[here.](http://uecho.sheffield.ac.uk:8080/ess/echo/presentation/cf5b4a10-cf6c-4446-b843-ff07fa741fa0)

### Probability Review

If you feel your basic probability needs brushing up, you might want to
watch this lecture from 2012-13. It covers basic concepts of
probability.

Lab Class
---------

Probabilities with Python and the iPython Notebook.

The notebook for the lab class can be downloaded from
[here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/SheffieldML/notebook/blob/master/lab_classes/machine_learning/MLAI_lab1.ipynb).

To obtain the lab class in ipython notebook, first open the ipython
notebook. Then paste the following code into the ipython notebook

    import urllib
    urllib.urlretrieve('https://github.com/SheffieldML/notebook/blob/master/lab_classes/machine_learning/MLAI_lab1.ipynb', 'MLAI_lab1.ipynb')

You should now be able to find the lab class by clicking `File->Open` on
the ipython notebook menu.

Solutions for the lab class can be downloaded from this notebook
[here](./MLAI_lab1_answers.ipynb).
