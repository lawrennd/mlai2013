### Sheet 1

The first [Tutorial Sheet](./assets/tutorialOne.pdf) is now available.

The answers for tutorial 1 are now available
[here](./assets/tutorialOneSolutions.pdf). Make sure you have fully attempted
each question on the tutorial *before* looking at the answer provided.
By fully attempted I mean sat down and had a go at the whole thing,
thinking about it for some time when you are stuck and consulting the
lectures and course books. Then, and only then, should you look at the
answer and compare it to that which you have prepared.
