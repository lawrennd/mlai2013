Python does integer division if you write int/int. Since the size of the data is 27 (and an integer) 27/2=13, not 13.5. This is an irritating feature of the programming language, but should have been fixed. Loose one for failing to notice this.

You would also loose marks for using `np.linalg.inv` instead of `np.linalg.solve`.<br>Mark: <b>4.0</b> out of 5.0</p><p><br><br><b>Question 1(b)</b><br><b>Comment:</b> This is a straightforward question, it just involves replacing the basis provied (which is quadratic) instead of the linear basis.

This same task was seen in the second lab class.<br>Mark: <b>5.0</b> out of 5.0</p><p><br><br><b>Question 1(c)</b><br><b>Comment:</b> This is due to numerical problems. Range of weights required to add up the basis to make the whole thing come out around 3 to 5 would be very large. Computations on computers are best done around 1 for best numerical accuracy, but the coefficient associated with the 8th order term would have to be $\\mathcal{O}(2012^{-8})$ to keep the final contribution of that term in line with the others.<br>Mark: <b>3.0</b> out of 5.0</p><p><br><br><b>Question 2(a)</b><br><b>Comment:</b> This is also a straightforward warm up question.

It's not a good fit.<br>Mark: <b>0.0</b> out of 1.0</p><p><br><br><b>Question 2(e)</b><br><b>Comment:</b> Where is the hold out error being computed? The hold out error minimum should be associated with relatively few basis functions. If everything is implemented correctly it comes out as 1. Minor mistakes may make the number of basis one fewer or greater. Validation error should fluctuate a lot.<br>Mark: <b>5.0</b> out of 10.0</p><p><br><br><b>Question 2(f)(i)</b><br><b>Comment:</b> you didn't compute the correct error here, it needs to be the error on the left out point. It should be minima at 6 basis functions. This was a requested piece of work for the polynomial basis functions in the 3rd lab class. <br>Mark: <b>5.0</b> out of 10.0</p><p><br><br><b>Question 2(f)(ii)</b><br><b>Comment:</b> You should use a loop for holding out the various parts. You also didn't select the held out points correctly, they should be randomly chosen from the data set. <br>Mark: <b>2.0</b> out of 10.0</p><p><br><br><b>Question 3(a)</b><br><b>Comment:</b> This question is basically a test of the ability to map the marginal likelihood equation to a piece of code. Minor pit falls are if the student simply performs integer division, python has an annoying habit of returning an integer. Here you do need to use the inverse of $\\mathbf{K}$. We don't expect to see $\\sigma^2$ or $\\alpha$ fitted, although that would be the correct thing to do, we haven't covered non-linear optimisation in the course which is what would be required. The marginal likelihood should select a model with relatively few basis functions (3). If it hasn't then there's something wrong. One potential issue is that since this is a likelihood we are looking for a maximum, rather than a minimum we look for with an error.<br>Mark: <b>0.0</b> out of 10.0</p><p><br><br><b>Question 3(b)</b><br><b>Comment:</b> Here the posterior mean and covariance are given as equations above, the challenge is to interpret them correctly and combine them with the mapping function to get the correct predictions for the mean of $f$ and it's marginal standard deviation. Here we ask for the plot to be extended beyond the original range so that the behaviour of the fit can be seen outside the area of the data. If everything is correct then the basis functions will be seen to be dropping away from the data towards zero and initially error bars increase, but as you move further from the data error bars collapse.<br>Mark: <b>0.0</b> out of 10.0</p><p><br><br><b>Question 3(c)</b><br><b>Comment:</b> We covered sampling in this manner in the 4th lab class. The challenge here is only to use the multivariate normal sampler correctly, and make the correct use of the resulting samples. The covariance and mean have already been computed for the previous question.<br>Mark: <b>0.0</b> out of 5.0</p><p><br><br><b>Question 3(d)</b><br><b>Comment:</b> We are looking for some particular observations here. 1) The error bars are poor when there is no data, this is a very bad feature of fixed basis function models, and one that is fixed by using Gaussian processes which implicitly have infinite basis functions. 2) The error bars seem probably too large in general. This can be fixed a little by reducing the noise.
