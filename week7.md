Lab Class
---------

The notebook for the lab class can be downloaded from
[here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/SheffieldML/notebook/blob/master/lab_classes/machine_learning/MLAI_lab5.ipynb).

To obtain the lab class in ipython notebook, first open the ipython
notebook. Then paste the following code into the ipython notebook

    import urllib
    urllib.urlretrieve('https://github.com/SheffieldML/notebook/blob/master/lab_classes/machine_learning/MLAI_lab5.ipynb', 'MLAI_lab5.ipynb')

You should now be able to find the lab class by clicking `File->Open` on
the ipython notebook menu.
