Regression
==========

For this week the lecture slides are available
[here](./assets/w2_regression.pdf).

### YouTube Video

There is a YouTube video available of me giving this material at the
Gaussian Process Road Show in Uganda.

You will need to watch this in HD to make the maths clearer.

Lab Class
---------

Linear regression with numpy and Python.

The notebook for the lab class can be downloaded from
[here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/SheffieldML/notebook/blob/master/lab_classes/machine_learning/MLAI_lab2.ipynb).

To obtain the lab class in ipython notebook, first open the ipython
notebook. Then paste the following code into the ipython notebook

    import urllib
    urllib.urlretrieve('https://github.com/SheffieldML/notebook/blob/master/lab_classes/machine_learning/MLAI_lab2.ipynb', 'MLAI_lab2.ipynb')

You should now be able to find the lab class by clicking `File->Open` on
the ipython notebook menu.
