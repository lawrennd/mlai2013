Machine Learning and Adaptive Intelligence
==========================================

This unit aims to provide a deep understanding of the fundamental
technologies underlying modern artificial intelligence. In particular it
will provide foundational understanding of probability and statistical
modelling, supervised learning for classification and regression, and
unsupervised learning for data exploration. The teaching consists of two
hours of lectures and one of lab classes each week. The lectures are on
Tuesdays, the labs on Fridays. The teaching schedule and venue for each
week are given below:

1.  Tuesday 12-14 MAPP-LT11; Friday 10-11 Regent Court G12 Lab Class
2.  Tuesday 12-14 MAPP-LT11; Friday 10-11 Regent Court G12 Lab Class
3.  Tuesday 12-14 MAPP-LT11; Friday 10-11 Regent Court G12 Lab Class
4.  Tuesday 12-14 MAPP-LT11; Friday 10-11 Regent Court G12 Lab Class
5.  Tuesday 12-14 MAPP-LT11; Friday 10-11 Regent Court G12 Lab Class
    (Neil will leave at around 10:25)

Recommended text book
---------------------

The main course recommended text is [Rogers and Girolami's "A First
Course in Machine
Learning"](http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~srogers/firstcourseml/). Also
useful is [Bishop, Pattern Recognition and Machine
Learning](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/cmbishop/prml/).
Most lectures will provide references to these text, and it will help a
lot if you read the relevant sections in your own time.

A further publicly available text is [Hastie et. al, The Elements of
Statistical
Learning](http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/).

Pre-requisites
--------------

You are expected to have familiarity with basic probability and linear
algebra. We will use Python and the ipython notebook on the course, so
you are expected to be comfortable with adapting to a new programming
environment without specific tuition.

Lecture Slides
--------------

The material for the lectures will be posted below before each lecture
(including audio and screen capture, where possible). We aim to put up
the materials for each week's lectures at the beginning of week.

Week 1: Uncertainty and Probability

Introduction to Numerical Computing in Python Lab Class

Week 2: Regression

Linear Regression in the Lab

Week 3: Generalization

Generalization Lab

Assignment distributed

Week 4: Classification

Classification Lab

Week 5: Bayesian Inference

Week 6: Reading Week

Week 7: Gaussian Processes

Bayesian Regression Lab
