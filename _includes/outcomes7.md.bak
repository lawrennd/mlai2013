Learning Outcomes Week 7
------------------------

-   Understanding how the marginal likelihood in a Gaussian Bayesian
    regression model can be computed using properties of the
    multivariate Gaussian.
-   Understanding that Bayesian Regression Models put a joint Gaussian
    prior across the data.
-   Understanding that we can specify the covariance function of that
    prior directly.
-   Understanding that Gaussian process models generalize basis function
    models to allow *infinite* basis functions.
