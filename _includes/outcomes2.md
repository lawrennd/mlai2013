Learning Outcomes Week 2
------------------------

Consolidate understanding of stages of a basic probabilistic machine
learning:

-   Write down model.
-   Make an assumption about the errors.
-   Use combination of mathematical model and error assumptions to write
    down a likelihood
-   Maximize the likelihood with respect to the parameters of the model
-   Use the resulting model to make predictions.

Understand the principles of using gradient methods to find a fixed
point equation to maximize a likelihoood.

Understand the weakness of coordinate descent methods when parameters
are correlated.

Understand the advantages of using multivariate calculus to maximize the
likelihood in linear regression.

Understand how basis functions can be used to go from linear models to
non-linear models.
