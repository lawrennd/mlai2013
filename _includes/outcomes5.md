Learning Outcomes Week 5
------------------------

-   Understand the principal of integrating parameters and how to use
    Bayes rule to do so.
-   Understand the role of the prior distribution.
-   In multivariate and univariate Gaussian examples, be able to combine
    the prior with the likelihood to form a posterior distribution..
-   Recognise the role of the marginal likelihood and know its form for
    Bayesian regression under Gaussian priors.
-   Be able to compute the expected output of the model and its
    covariance using the posterior distribution and the formula for the
    function.
-   Understand the effect of model averaging and its advantages when
    making predictions including:
    -   Error bars
    -   Regularized prediction (reduces variance)
