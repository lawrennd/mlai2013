Learning Outcomes Week 3
------------------------

-   Understand the challenge of model selection.
-   Understand the difference between training set, test set and
    validation set.
-   Understand and be able to apply appropriately the following
    approaches to model validation:
    -   hold out set,
    -   leave one out cross validation,
    -   *k*-fold cross validation.
-   Be able to identify the type of error that arises from *bias* and
    the type of error that arises from *variance*.
-   Be able to distinguish between different types of uncertainty:
    aleatoric and epistemic. Be able to give examples of each type.
-   Be able to derive Bayes rule' from the product rule of probability.
-   Understand the meaning of the terms *prior*, *posterior* and
    *marginal likelihood*
    -   Be able to identify these terms in Bayes' rule.
    -   Be able to describe what each of these terms represents (belief
        before observation, belief after observation, relationship
        between belief and observation, the model score.)
-   Understand how to derive the marginal likelihood from the likelihood
    and the prior.
-   Understand the difference between the frequentist approach and the
    Bayesian approach, i.e. that in the Bayesian approach parameters are
    treated as random variables
-   Be able to derive the maths to perform a simple Bayesian update on
    the offset parameter of a regression problem.
